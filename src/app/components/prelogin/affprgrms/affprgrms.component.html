                <p class="programs_it">Types of affiliate programs.</p>

                <p>There are two basic compensation types for poker affiliate programs, revenue share and cost per
                    acquisition.</p>

                <p class="programs_aff">
                    <span class="programs_name">Revenue Share - MGR</span>
                    <br>MGR is an option that every online poker room offers.
                    The MGR option is where the affiliate receives a percentage of the revenue generated by the players
                    that have been sent to the poker room by the affiliate.
                    Most poker affiliate programs offer between 20% and 30% MGR for the revenue generated.
                    <br>MGR is typically the best option for affiliates who send high stakes poker players or poker
                    enthusiasts who play a large amount of hands.
                    These players will generate more rake by either playing in higher value games or by playing a large
                    volume of hands at a lower value.
                    Of course, a combination of high stakes and high volume is the most desireable type of player for an
                    affiliate to have because they generate the very most income possible.
                </p>

                <p class="programs_aff">
                    <span class="programs_name">Cost Per Acquisition - CPA </span>
                    <br>CPA is an option that over half of the online poker affiliate programs offer. Unlike MGR, CPA is
                    not a share of the revenue generated by the players sent to the online poker room, but rather a lump
                    sum of money per player sent. Most online poker rooms offer between $65 and $100 per player in the
                    CPA commission model.
                    <br>CPA is the best option for affiliates who send players that are not high stakes players or poker
                    enthusiasts. Regular players will generate a typical amount of revenue or less and a prepaid
                    commission such as CPA is paid before that revenue is actually generated. This makes it so you don't
                    have to worry about your players generating a large amount of money before you are paid.
